**ShadowTrade** is a pioneering Uniswap v4 hook that enables **fully private limit orders** using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). All order parameters including price, size, and direction remain encrypted until execution, eliminating front-running and MEV extraction.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 **Fully Private Orders**
- **Encrypted Trigger Prices**: Order prices remain hidden until execution
- **Hidden Order Sizes**: Market impact concealed from competitors  
- **Private Directions**: Buy/sell intentions encrypted
- **Confidential Expirations**: Order lifetimes protected

### ⚡ **Advanced Execution Engine**
- **Smart Fill Logic**: Optimal partial fill calculations
- **Priority-Based Execution**: Time and price-weighted order priority
- **Slippage Protection**: Built-in price impact safeguards
- **Liquidity-Aware**: Real-time liquidity assessment

### 🛡️ **Production Security**
- **Emergency Pause**: Circuit breaker for critical situations
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permission system
- **Reentrancy Guards**: MEV attack protection
- **Fee Management**: Configurable execution fees with caps

### 📊 **Comprehensive Order Management**
- **Partial Fills**: Volume-weighted average price tracking
- **Order Expiration**: Time-based order lifecycle management
- **Fill History**: Detailed execution tracking
- **Order Cancellation**: User and emergency cancellation support
